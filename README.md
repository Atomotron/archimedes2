# Archimedes Engine 2



Our team wrote [a WebGL engine](https://github.com/Atomotron/ld47-prep) for Ludum Dare 47. It worked pretty well, so for Lumdum Dare 48 we are making a second version. The engine is named *Archimedes Engine 2*, because it's based on the engine we used to create [Shadow of Archimedes](https://github.com/Atomotron/shadow-of-archimedes).
